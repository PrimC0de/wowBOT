SOURCING MANAGEMENT The sourcing process begins with the alignment of procurement plans with business needs, followed by detailed source determination and planning. The Business Requestor is responsible for creating a Business Case that defines the need. The selection should be based on a cost-benefit analysis. Approved purchasing approaches include: Buying from a Catalog: For standard items with pre-set prices. Buying from the Preferred Supplier List (PSL): This should be the first option where practical. Buying from Online Suppliers: Permitted when traditional channels are unavailable, subject to commercial comparison and approval. Competitive Bidding: Required for purchases above a certain annual spending threshold. Splitting orders to avoid this is prohibited. The primary method is the Request for Quotation (RFQ). The RFQ process is divided into two types: RFQ Nilai Kecil (Small Value): For non-outsourcing projects between IDR 100 million and IDR 500 million. It requires a simplified RFQ and a minimum of 2 proposals. RFQ Nilai Besar (Large Value): For all outsourcing projects or non-outsourcing projects above IDR 500 million. It requires a full Business Case and a minimum of 3 requests and 2 proposals. Approval involves more senior levels, including the VMC depending on the value. For purchases up to IDR 100 million, direct selection with a single quote is allowed. For amounts above this, the RFQ process is mandatory.

The procurement process also allows for purchasing via online suppliers and corporate credit cards, each with specific procedures and approvals. For online purchases with non-negotiable terms, the respective business owner's head (SMC) must review and approve if gaps exist. VII. OUTSOURCING MANAGEMENT Outsourcing is the delegation of supporting work to a third party. The Bank differentiates between core work and supporting work. Only supporting work can be outsourced. This work must be low-risk, not require high banking competency, and not be directly related to decision-making that affects the Bank's operations. The outsourcing provider must be an Indonesian legal entity, have a valid business license, good financial performance and reputation, and adequate resources. All outsourcing procurement and reporting must be approved by the Vendor Management Committee (VMC). VIII. SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT The supplier assessment process must be transparent and based on a thorough evaluation of the supplier's capabilities. A risk assessment must be conducted, with details specified in the Third-Party Risk Management Guideline. Suppliers must be registered in the procurement system before a PR/PO can be processed. Business functions are responsible for continuously monitoring supplier performance. A supplier blacklist is maintained to prohibit suppliers from future participation. A supplier can be blacklisted for code of ethics violations (bribery, data privacy breach), causing commercial loss, or being involved in legal cases like

Blacklist registration is approved by the Head of Procurement and reported to the VMC. There is no process for removing a supplier from the blacklist. IX. AGREEMENT MANAGEMENT All agreements must be reviewed by the Legal team before execution. A formal written agreement is required before any activity can begin. Contracts that are considered "Material Contracts" must be approved by the VMC before signing. A contract is considered material if it involves managing Bank assets over IDR 3.5 billion, the vendor has a high TPRA result, or the scope of work is critical and irreplaceable (e.g., Core Banking System). X. REQUISITION TO PAY PR and PO are the main tools for confirming purchases. A PR must be approved based on its value before a PO is issued. After goods/services are received, the Requestor must promptly perform a Goods Receipt (GR) in the system. The standard payment term is 60 days from the receipt of a complete invoice. Invoices received before a PO is issued are considered "After the Fact" (ATF) and require approval from the CFO. XI.

DEVIATION Any deviation from this policy requires approval from the Finance Director/CFO and the relevant Senior Management Committee (SMC) member.
