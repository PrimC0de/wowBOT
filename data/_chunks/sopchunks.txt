The scope of this SOP covers the mechanism for creating business case documents, filling out Request For Quotation (RFQ) documents, the vendor risk assessment process, filling out vendor performance evaluation documents, and reporting on outsourcing plans, changes, and issues. This SOP applies to all Bank work units that use products and services from suppliers and will be supported by Procurement and relevant Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). This SOP is effective from its approval date until a new version is issued. BASIS OF REFERENCE This SOP refers to the latest internal procurement policy and the latest vendor risk management guidelines. DEFINITIONS Procurement is the activity of procuring goods and services from suppliers (vendors). A Vendor or Supplier refers to an individual, agent, entity, or company in a business relationship with the Bank for supplying goods and services under a contract. This includes both outsourced and non-outsourced goods and services and is regulated by the Procurement policy. The Vendor Management Committee (VMC) is a body of the Senior Management Committee (SMC) that manages discussions about vendors and relationships. It meets regularly to decide on supplier selection based on thresholds and other supplier management items. The Senior Management Committee (SMC) comprises the Board of Directors and Senior Management. The Board of Directors is responsible for the company's management. Vendor Risk Assessment (VRA) is the due diligence process to ensure selected suppliers have adequate risk mitigation controls and capabilities. A Business Owner (Requestor) is a unit or individual who identifies business needs, initiates procurement requests, and represents the Bank in business with suppliers. A Contract Owner is a unit or individual responsible for the overall contract strategy with suppliers. A Subject Matter Expert (SME) is a relevant expert who identifies, assesses, mitigates, and monitors potential risks during the procurement process. A Business Case is a document from a systematic analysis to evaluate the need, value, and feasibility of a

A Contract Owner is a unit or individual responsible for the overall contract strategy with suppliers. A Subject Matter Expert (SME) is a relevant expert who identifies, assesses, mitigates, and monitors potential risks during the procurement process. A Business Case is a document from a systematic analysis to evaluate the need, value, and feasibility of a procurement to ensure it brings maximum benefit to the Bank. A Request for Quotation (RFQ) is a document or process to request proposals and price offers from potential vendors based on detailed needs. The Vendor Performance Evaluation Form is a document summarizing vendor performance monitoring activities, including SLAs, performance standards, and event reports. The contract and business owner conduct regular monitoring. The Vendor Risk Assessment (VRA) Extension Form is a document for committing to a new timeline if the VRA process exceeds its deadline. An Outsourcing plan report is a report containing information on the type of work, scope, agreement type, estimated number of workers, agreement period, purpose, and cost-benefit and risk analysis of outsourcing. A report on additions and/or changes to outsourcing contains information on changes to the planned outsourced work. A report on problematic outsourcing includes the type of work, the service provider's name, a description of the problem, and the Bank's steps to address it. An IT Service Provider (PPJTI) is a third party that assists in the Bank's operational processes, such as consultants, advisors, and implementers focused on IT services. GENERAL PROVISIONS The scope of Procurement covers all strategic, tactical, and transactional procurement activities and governance. The scope of vendor risk management, specifically the Vendor Risk Assessment (VRA), applies to all new and renewed cooperations with vendors for goods and services, following the latest vendor risk management

MECHANISMS Mechanism for Business Case Document Creation The Business Owner (BO) provides supporting information for the business case, which includes an Executive Summary (scope, justification, recommendation), Description of the proposed arrangement (details, timeline, SLA), Evaluation (build vs buy analysis from SMEs), Financial information & Benefits (costs, expenditure type), Customer Referral, and Other Operational Factors (e.g., Business Continuity Plan). The BO then gets approval from the head level / SMC-1 and works with the Procurement Division. Mechanism for Request For Quotation/Proposal (RFQ/P) Document The Business Owner (BO) provides supporting documents related to Project Background (instructions, context, schedule, scope) and Requirements (terms, conditions, technical specs, SLA, penalty). Tender requests can be emailed to procurement@superbank.id. Mechanism for Vendor Risk Assessment (VRA) Step 1: Determine VRA applicability. VRA is required if the activity is determined to be outsourcing, involves a PPJTI, or the average annual contract value exceeds IDR 3,000,000,000. Step 2: Risk Assessment. The BO must complete the VRA form before finalizing the contract. This includes general information about the product and vendor, and a risk assessment based on SME criteria. The questionnaire must be completed by the appropriate BO and approved by the Head/SMC-1. A new VRA is needed for scope changes that increase risk. Step 3: Risk Evaluation.

The questionnaire must be completed by the appropriate BO and approved by the Head/SMC-1. A new VRA is needed for scope changes that increase risk. Step 3: Risk Evaluation. Procurement ensures the questionnaire is complete. For Low inherent risk, the vendor is recommended for approval by the Head/Business Owner. For Medium and High inherent risk, it is escalated to SMEs for mitigation planning. For Low residual risk, the vendor is recommended for approval by the Head/Business Owner. For Medium and High residual risk, the vendor is recommended for approval by the VMC. Step 4: Approval. Any follow-up actions for identified gaps must be completed by the business owner. If the VRA process is delayed, a VRA Extension Form must be completed. Any deviations from the vendor management process require VMC approval. Mechanism for Vendor Performance Evaluation Document The Business/Contract Owner must conduct performance evaluations according to the contract's agreed period. The BO provides information on the vendor's compliance with contract terms, quality, SLA, time commitment, problem correction, communication, cooperation, improvement initiatives, invoicing, and a recommendation. For Outsourcing, the evaluation is at least once a year. For non-Outsourcing vendors, it is at least once a year for High Residual Risk, every two years for Medium Residual Risk, and every three years for Low Residual Risk. Mechanism for Reporting Outsourcing For planned and changed outsourcing, the Contract/Business Owners provide a document with the type of work, scope, agreement type, estimated workforce, agreement term, purpose, and cost-benefit/risk analysis. Procurement consolidates, Compliance reviews, VMC approves, and
